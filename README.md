 Tony. I have successfully created a database of the images from my assignment 2. I have deployed a database driven gallery to Heroku and MongoDB Atlas. However after a sucessful "deploy branch" on Heroku, I eventually get and "application error" when I want to view the page. I am fairly confident the problem is not with my model/schema or the database. I have checked that all required dependencies are included in my node_modules folder including mongoose, ejs (which I chose for ease of use) and express. 
 I have left my index page alone with the exception of requiring the footer partial. Login, gallery and register all have a header partial as well. 
 I regret that I did not get a functioning web page up and running, but I think that you will be able to at least establish that I have a grasp of the fundamentals the backend in this assignment.
